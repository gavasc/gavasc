# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ§ªCurrently Brewing In My Digital Lab
These days, you'll find me deep in the rabbit holes of Elixir and Go, two languages that couldn't be more different, yet somehow both make my brain light up in the best way possible.

## ðŸŽ¯What Gets Me Excited

- **Elixir's Magic**: Actor models, fault tolerance, "let it crash" and functional programming
- **Go's Simplicity**: Goroutines, channels, and the art of doing more with less: minimalism that just works
- **Reading**: Always eager to learn new things
- **Gaming**: A great refuge from reality
